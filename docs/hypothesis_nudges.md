### **Potential Formulated Nudge Hypotheses**
* **H_N4 (Cost & Education):** "An informational nudge that concretely **reduces the perceived cost of participation** (e.g., providing a polling place locator, information on off-peak voting times, or free transport options) will cause a disproportionately larger increase in turnout among archetypes with **lower educational attainment** compared to those with higher educational attainment."
    * **Rationale:** This hypothesis posits that practical barriers are a stronger deterrent for less-resourced or less-informed groups. Voters with higher education may have already overcome these cost barriers, making the nudge less impactful for them. It links **Cost of Participation** with **Education Background**.

* **H_N5 (Overconfidence & Competitiveness):** "For voters exhibiting high **overconfidence**, a nudge emphasizing **electoral competitiveness** (e.g., 'This election will be decided by a handful of votes') will be more effective at increasing turnout than a nudge emphasizing **civic duty**."
> Communicating that the election is expected to be close (“This race could be decided by a few votes”) will increase turnout among risk-tolerant archetypes but not among highly risk-averse ones.
    * **Rationale:** This tests if overconfident individuals are more motivated by the belief that their single vote is pivotal and influential rather than by a moral or social obligation. It pits the **Overconfidence** bias against the influence of **Civic Duty** in the context of a close election.

* **H_N6 (Risk Aversion & Social Pressure):** "A **social pressure** nudge that highlights turnout as a community norm (e.g., 'A record number of your neighbors are voting in this election') will be more effective at increasing turnout among voters with **high risk aversion** than a nudge that focuses on the potential negative outcomes of the election."
> Displaying local average turnout rates (“Most people in your community voted last time”) will significantly increase turnout among individuals with moderate civic duty and strong partisan identity, by amplifying perceived social norms.
    * **Rationale:** This hypothesis suggests that risk-averse individuals are more motivated by the "safe" choice of conforming to a social norm than by the uncertainty of potential political outcomes. It frames non-voting as a social risk (being an outlier). It connects **Risk Aversion** with **Social Pressure**.
    Social cues reinforce belonging and accountability; they are particularly powerful among individuals with partisan identities or moderate civic engagement.
    Risk-tolerant voters perceive higher utility from participation when outcomes are uncertain; risk-averse voters prefer predictability and may disengage from uncertainty.


* **H_N7 (Habit & Partisan Identity):** "For archetypes with a strong **voting habit**, a simple reminder nudge that reinforces their **partisan identity** (e.g., 'Democrats/Republicans are counting on you to vote on Tuesday!') will be sufficient to ensure high turnout. Conversely, this same nudge will have a negligible effect on sporadic voters, regardless of their partisan identity strength."
    * **Rationale:** This hypothesis aims to determine if habit is the dominant factor for frequent voters. It suggests that for this group, the nudge only needs to activate an existing behavior pattern rather than persuade, whereas non-habitual voters require a more compelling intervention. It connects **Voting as a Habit** with **Partisan Identity Strength**.
> Sending a (personalised "name")“Thank you for voting” message post-election (reinforcing the identity of being a voter) will increase likelihood of voting in subsequent elections, strengthening habitual voting behavior over time. Along with encourgaing them to put it in social media handles making the influencers start it would significantly increase the turnout in the youth.
### **Hₙ5: Social Accountability Nudge**

**Feature(s):** Social Pressure, Overconfidence, Civic Duty
**Hypothesis:**

> Informing voters that their participation may be publicly known (e.g., “Voting records are public information”) will increase turnout among low-confidence or moderate-duty individuals, but could backfire among highly overconfident individuals (who may perceive it as coercion). 

**Rationale:**
Social pressure and accountability increase the psychological cost of abstention, but reactance may occur in confident or autonomous individuals.

### **Hₙ1: Monetary / Effort-Reduction Nudge**

**Feature(s):** Cost of participation, Voting habit, Civic duty
**Hypothesis:**

> Providing a small, lottery-based monetary reward or reducing the time/effort to vote (e.g., pre-filled registration reminders) will significantly increase turnout among low-habit, low-duty voters, but will have minimal impact on those with high civic duty or established voting habits.

**Rationale:**
When voting feels costly, low-duty individuals are more responsive to tangible incentives (monetary or convenience-based). Those with strong habits or civic duty are less sensitive to such changes.

### **Hₙ6: Issue Salience / Personal Relevance Nudge**

**Feature(s):** Issue Salience, Electoral Competitiveness, Education background
**Hypothesis:**

> Highlighting personally relevant issues (“This election will affect [X issue you rated highly]”) will increase turnout more than general election reminders, particularly for educated and politically aware archetypes.

**Rationale:**
Educated voters with strong issue interests are more motivated when a clear, personally relevant connection is made.

### **Hₙ8: Personality–Candidate Congruence Nudge**

**Feature(s):** Voting candidates (perceived integrity/personality match), Partisan Identity Strength
**Hypothesis:**

> Reminding voters of perceived personality congruence with a candidate (“This candidate shares your values and traits”) will increase turnout among weakly partisan voters, but will have limited effect among strong partisans.

**Rationale:**
For low-identity voters, candidate-personality matching can substitute for party loyalty as a voting motivation.
