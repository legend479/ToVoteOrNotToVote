A wider range of competent candidates representing diverse perspectives would make it easier to find someone who truly aligns with my values, aspirations and ideas of 'good governance'. 
- I’d also feel more confident voting if there were greater transparency about politicians’ wealth, track records, and the real outcomes of government schemes, all presented in a way that’s easily accessible. It would make it easier to hold leaders accountable and make an informed choice.
