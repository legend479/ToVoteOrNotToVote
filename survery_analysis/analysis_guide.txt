### Composite Scores Created

The scripts automatically create:
- `civic_duty_score` - Direct from Q5
- `social_pressure_score` - Direct from Q8
- `habit_score` - Reverse coded Q2
- `cost_score` - Average of Q3, Q9

## 📈 KEY INSIGHTS YOU'LL GET

### 1. Distribution Insights
- Which emotions dominate? (Q1)
- How many habitual voters? (Q2)
- Effort sensitivity distribution (Q3)
- Trust levels in system (Q7, Q10)

### 2. Correlation Insights
- Do civic-minded people also trust the system?
- Is habit correlated with emotional connection?
- Does social pressure work differently by age?
- Cost-benefit trade-offs in decision-making

### 3. Archetype Insights
- **Type 1**: High civic duty, strong habit (reliable voters)
- **Type 2**: Low civic duty, high social pressure (nudge-able)
- **Type 3**: Cost-sensitive, low engagement (need incentives)
- **Type 4**: [Data-driven discovery]

### 4. Hypothesis Validation
- Which model components are significant predictors?
- Effect sizes for model calibration
- Interaction effects (e.g., age × social influence)
- Nudge mechanism specificity

## 🔧 FOR YOUR MODEL CALIBRATION

### Extended Rational Choice Model
Use correlation coefficients as starting weights:
```
U(vote) = β₁×B - β₂×C + β₃×D + β₄×S + β₅×H

Where β coefficients come from your regression results
```

### Drift-Diffusion Model
- **Drift rate (μ)**: Function of D, S, H, B
- **Threshold (a)**: Modulated by trust score
- **Starting point (z)**: Shifted by habit score
- **Noise (σ)**: Related to information load (Q9)

### Dual-System Model
- **System 1 weight (λ)**: Higher for high Q8, low Q9
- **System 2 weight (1-λ)**: Higher for high Q5, high Q7

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError"**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn statsmodels
```

**Issue: "No composite scores found"**
- Run `comprehensive_analysis.py` first
- It creates all necessary composite scores

**Issue: "Empty plots"**
- Check your data has been converted to numeric
- Verify using `voter_survey_original_numeric.csv`

**Issue: "Low sample size warnings"**
- Normal for subgroup analyses with N=72
- Focus on overall patterns, not small subgroups
