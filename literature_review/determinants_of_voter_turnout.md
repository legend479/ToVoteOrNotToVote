### Study Goals and Background

- The study’s core objective is to empirically analyze how sociodemographic traits, political and ideological identification, risk aversion, and cognitive biases (like overconfidence and the “winning effect”) individually and jointly affect the probability of voting in elections.
- This inquiry responds to a gap in past work, which rarely integrates behavioral economics concepts (like cognitive bias) with traditional models of turnout.

### Hypotheses Formulated

Nine primary hypotheses were tested:
1. Older individuals are more likely to vote.
2. Higher education increases the probability of voting.
3. No gender difference in turnout when controlling for other variables.
4. Strong ideological identification might **decrease** likelihood of voting.
5. Party identification increases likelihood of voting.
6. High risk aversion reduces likelihood of voting.
7. Past election “winning effect” (supporting a successful candidate) boosts, “losing effect” diminishes, future turnout.
8. Anchoring to party decision increases likelihood of voting.
9. Overconfidence in political knowledge increases likelihood of voting.[1]

### Theoretical Framing

- The work draws from theories in behavioral political economy and political psychology.
- It considers direct (demographics, identification) and indirect (risk attitudes, cognitive distortions) influences, recognizing that political and party identification, personality, and cognitive bias all interact to shape turnout.
- The self-report survey design allows testing both classic predictors and new behavioral variables.

### Methodology

- **Sample**: 103 adult respondents (average age: 33, range 19–62; 41% male).
- **Data Collection**: Online questionnaire, run over 6 days in July 2021, covering self-reported voting, attitudes, risk, confidence, party/ideology, and demographics.
- **Variable Construction**:
    - *Latent variables* (risk aversion, overconfidence, anchoring effect, etc.) identified via exploratory factor analysis with psychometric reliability checks (Cronbach’s alpha, Bartlett’s, KMO statistics).
    - *Dependent variable:* Binary, whether respondent voted in the last election.
- **Model**: Multivariate logit regression, reporting marginal effects of each variable on the probability of voting.

### Key Findings and Results

- **Sociodemographic impacts**:
    - **Income**: Robust, positive influence on turnout.
    - **Education**: Contrary to expectations, *secondary and higher education* correlated with lower, not higher, likelihood of voting (relative to primary/basic education), rejecting the classic education-turnout hypothesis for this sample.
    - **Age**: Negative, non-significant effect—doesn’t support the expectation that older people turn out more.
    - **Gender**: No significant effect, confirming the expectation that gender gap in turnout has vanished when controlling for other factors.

- **Behavioral and psychological predictors**:
    - **Risk Aversion (RA)**: High risk aversion (preference for certainty) *reduces* likelihood of voting; more risk-tolerant individuals participate more.
    - **Winning Effect (WE)**: Voters whose choice succeeded in the last election (“winners”) are significantly *more likely* to participate in the next—emotional outcomes matter.
    - **Losing Effect (LE)**: Not significant; losing doesn’t have a clear independent effect.
    - **Overconfidence (OV)**: High self-confidence in political knowledge significantly increases turnout probability. Overconfident voters are more engaged, possibly regardless of accuracy.
    - **Party Identification (PI)**: Positive but statistically insignificant effect—being attached to a party does not guarantee higher turnout in this model.
    - **Ideological Identification (II)**: Strong ideological conviction *decreases* probability of voting, possibly due to disillusionment, ideological incongruence, or party-system dissatisfaction.
    - **Anchoring Effect (AE)**: Insignificant—following the party line or being anchored to group opinions was not a significant determinant.

### Detailed Statistical Controls and Checks

- Factor analysis established reliable constructs for each latent behavioral variable.
- Multivariate logit model preferred (over demographic-only models) based on fit statistics (AIC/BIC).
- Marginal effect sizes estimated to interpret substantive impact on turnout probabilities.

### Limitations Acknowledged

- Sample size (N=103) is modest, limiting generalizability and the statistical power for more complex interactional or multilevel modeling.
- Not all external influences (trust in institutions, civic duty, feelings of anger, perceptions of democracy/corruption) are accounted for in this model.
- Self-reported survey during COVID-19, but justified by reliability findings for online behavioral measures.

### Major Contributions and Observations

- Risk aversion and cognitive biases like overconfidence and emotional “winning effect” have independent, substantial impacts on whether individuals vote.
- While much classic literature presumes income, education, age, and party link drive turnout, this analysis reveals significant exceptions—especially for education and ideology.
- Demonstrates the need to integrate psychological and behavioral variables for a modern theory of turnout.
- Suggests turnout interventions should address not just motivation, but underlying risk attitudes and cognitive perceptions.

### Conclusions

- Probability of voting is shaped by a complex mix of personal economic circumstances, psychological biases, and emotional reactions, not just rational calculation or group identity.
- Higher income, past electoral “wins,” overconfidence, and risk tolerance *increase* voting probability.
- Strong ideological conviction, higher formal education, and heightened risk aversion *decrease* or fail to increase voting likelihood.
- Behavioral science approaches reveal factors often missed by classic sociological or economic analyses.
