 - 13th Thursday: Last class of the semester for this course (prior to the project presentations on 19th) - I would consider it as an Honor if all attend. 

19th - presentations start at 2PM 

        - each team gets 15 minutes 

After all the presentations there will be a 15 minute MCQ test on the projects presented. 

by 22nd - Submit a report 

                Format:

                       Abstract (150 words)

                       Introduction & scope of the project ( ~500 words)

                       Methodology  - do make this very rigorous

                       Results - add plots & tables. Do statistical testing and include the details

                       Discussion (~300 to 500 words) - this is open and depends on the project

                       Limitation - be critical and open on this. 

In the final submission course side the following should be included: the ppt, all raw data & the report
